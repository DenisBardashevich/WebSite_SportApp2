                    Achieving success in fantasy kabaddi demands a careful assessment of 
                    player roles and their historical performance trends. Managers should 
                    balance their squad between raiders and defenders, while also factoring 
                    in all-rounders who can contribute in various aspects of the game. 
                    Our platform furnishes extensive analytics on player performance, 
                    covering raid success rates, tackle success rates, and average points 
                    per match.

                    Understanding the structure of actual tournaments is essential for 
                    team assembly. Various tournaments may possess distinct rules and 
                    scoring systems, influencing how points are allocated for raids, 
                    tackles, and bonus actions. Our platform adapts to these 
                    discrepancies, ensuring that your strategy remains effective across 
                    diverse formats.

                    The selection of captain and vice-captain becomes especially impactful
